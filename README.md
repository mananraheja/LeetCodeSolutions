# Rules

View / add problems in ListOfProblems.xlsx

Make sure you mention the problem name, difficulty, topic(s) and link. 

Make your own branch and push your solution files (.cpp, .py, .js, .java etc) along with your (optional but recommended for future reference) algorithm explanation (.txt, .docx etc).

Push your code and description to YOUR BRANCH ONLY, 

!! DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN !!

## Additional Guidelines

- Adhere to good coding standards / practices.
- Add enough comments for clear explanation.
- Have fun and collaborate : it is always a good idea to discuss your doubts and help others.
