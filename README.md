# Rules

View / add problems in ListOfProblems.xlsx

Make sure you mention the problem name, difficulty, topic(s) and link. You can find all that information on the leetcode problem description.

To solve problems adhering to specific topics, watch this YouTube video for understanding how to sort Excel spreadsheet grouping by a column. 

Make your own branch and push your solution files (.cpp, .cc, .py, .js, .java etc) along with your (optional but recommended for future reference) algorithm explanation (.txt, .docx etc).

Push your code and description to YOUR BRANCH ONLY !!

!! DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN !!

## Additional Guidelines

- Adhere to good coding standards / practices.
- Try solving the problem as much as possible yourself, on paper / white board, and then code it up.
- Add enough comments for clear explanation.
- Try solving the same problem from a variety of approaches.
- Have fun and collaborate : it is always a good idea to discuss your doubts and help others.
- Filenames should be something simple and obvious - like manan_1207 (<your name>_<problem number>) and manan_1207_help for the algorithm explanation.
- Solution explanations may be provided on a need to know basis.
